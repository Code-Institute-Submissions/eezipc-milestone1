The website has four pages.

Contact Us - Shows the email address of the company as well as a contact form.
Prices - Shows a list of recent prices to use the company's services.


 
## UX
 
 This website is aimed at potential customers of the company.
 The site provides clear and obvious information on what the company does, where the company is located and how to contact the company.
 
The site took the basic premise of it's existing wordpress site www.vildepesumaja.com. This is an old wordpress site and the company would like a change.

The company has one simple request. Make it easy for a potential customer to contact them. Therefore the company address, email and purpose is very evident on every page.

## Features

On every page, there is a background picture of a laundrette. 
There is a contact form on the Contact page.
There is a simple carousel slider on the prices page to show the prices the company charges.
There is an interactive Google Map on the "Find us" page that shows the exact location of the company.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
