# Project Name

This website has been set up to promote and advertise a laundrette in Tallinn, Estonia.

The website has four pages.
Home - The main page that has a menu and basic information about the company.
Find Us - The address of the company plus an interactive map
Contact Us - Shows the email address of the company as well as a contact form.
Prices - Shows a list of recent prices to use the company's services.

The website also had a privacy policy page and a terms page. These two pages have a basic white background. 

 
## UX
 
 This website is aimed at potential customers of the company.
 The site provides clear and obvious information on what the company does, where the company is located and how to contact the company.
 
The site took the basic premise of it's existing wordpress site www.vildepesumaja.com. This is an old wordpress site and the company would like a change.

The company has one simple request. Make it easy for a potential customer to contact them. Therefore the company address, email, phone number and purpose is very evident on every page.
The company would also like people to contact them via facebook. Therefore links to facebook are in the top and bottom of the page.
I added links to Twitter also. They company does not use Twitter at the moment but they have stressed it would be a possibility soon.

## Features

On every page, there is a background picture of a laundrette (except the privacy & terms page). 
There is a contact form on the Contact page.
There is a simple carousel slider on the prices page to show the prices the company charges.
There is an interactive Google Map on the "Find us" page that shows the exact location of the company.

The jumbotron reduces in size depending on screen size.
The container reduces in size depending on screen size.
The contact form is visible and usable on all screen sizes.
The map function is visible and usable on all screen sizes.


1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact" page
    2. Submitting the empty form shows an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Submitting a form with an invalid email address shows that a relevant error message appears
    4. Submitting a form with all inputs valid shows that a success message appears.

Tested all links on top and bottom of the page.
Both navbars work on various screen sizes.
Main image hides when screen gets to a specific size.
Form & Prices container switches to an overflow automatically when screen gets to a specific size.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
